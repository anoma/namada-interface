## Installation

Before using apps in this repo, we first need to install all dependencies.

### Ubuntu

_NOTE_ These instructions may work with other Ubuntu-based systems, but are only confirmed to work in Ubuntu.

```bash
# Install rustup
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Add WASM target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Install clang
sudo apt-get install -y clang

# Install pkg-config
sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config

# Install openssl development packages
sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev

# Install protoc
sudo apt-get install -y protobuf-compiler

# Install wasm-pack
curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh

# Install yarn and JS dependencies
npm install -g yarn

# within namada-interface/ base folder:
yarn

# Install web-ext
yarn global add web-ext
```

### macOS

```bash
# Install xcode
xcode-select --install

# Install rustup
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Add WASM target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Install clang
brew install clang

# Install pkg-config
brew install pkg-config

# Install openssl development packages
brew install libssl-dev

# Install protoc
brew install protobuf

# Install wasm-pack
curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh

# Install yarn and JS dependencies
npm install -g yarn

# within namada-interface/ base folder:
yarn

# Install web-ext
yarn global add web-ext
```

Finally, update your shell environment (e.g., in `~/.zshrc`) to set the following variables:

```
export CC=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang
AR=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-ar
```

#### Apple Silicon

On macOS, when using Apple Silicon architecture, in order to compile some packages for our wasm dependencies, you will need to install
the following:

```
# Mac M1/M2 only - install brew's version of llvm
brew install llvm
```

Then, in your shell profile (e.g., `~/.zshrc`), export the following environment variables:

```
# Mac M1/M2 only
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/include"
export CC=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang
export AR=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-ar
```

## Usage

### Local chain

Before you start the extension and interface, you will need at least a chain ID and an RPC URL. This can either be a local chain or an
existing network. If you know the chain ID and URL, you can skip the following and simply enter these values in the `apps/namada-interface/.env`
file (to see an example of the values you can set, see [.env.sample](./apps/namada-interface/.env.sample).)

To build and run the chain locally, you will need to clone <http://github.com/anoma/namada>.

1. In `namada/`, first run `make build`, then `make install`
2. Initialize a local chain with:

   ```bash
   namadac utils init-network --genesis-path genesis/e2e-tests-single-node.toml --wasm-checksums-path wasm/checksums.json --chain-prefix local --unsafe-dont-encrypt --localhost --allow-duplicate-ip
   ```

   Make note of the chain ID from this output! This will be used below where `{CHAIN_ID}` is denoted (replace these instances
   with the actual chain ID). 3. To transfer funds from faucet via the CLI, you will need to create a wallet:

   ```bash
   namadaw key gen --alias my-key
   ```

3. Before running the chain, you will need to change one configuration file:
   - On Linux: Edit `~/.local/share/namada/{CHAIN_ID}/setup/validator-0/.namada/{CHAIN_ID}/config.toml`
   - On macOS: Edit `~/Library/Application\ Support/Namada/{CHAIN_ID}/setup/validator-0/.namada/{CHAIN_ID}/config.toml`
4. In `config.toml`, change the line `cors_allowed_origins = []` to `cors_allowed_origins = ["*"]`, then save and close.
5. You can now start the local chain

   - On Linux:

   ```bash
   namadan --chain-id {CHAIN_ID} --base-dir ~/.local/share/Namada/{CHAIN_ID}/setup/validator-0/.namada ledger run
   ```

   - On macOS:

   ```bash
   namadan --chain-id {CHAIN_ID} --base-dir ~/Library/Application\ Support/Namada/{CHAIN_ID}/setup/validator-0/.namada ledger run
   ```

6. Edit the following value in `namada-interface/apps/namada-interface/.env` (remember to replace `{CHAIN_ID}`
   with the actual chain ID from above):

   ```bash
   REACT_APP_NAMADA_CHAIN_ID={CHAIN_ID}
   REACT_APP_NAMADA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:27657/
   ```

### Extension

Within `apps/extension/`, we may issue the following commands:

```bash
# Build wasm dependencies
yarn wasm:build

# Build wasm dependencies with debugging enabled
yarn wasm:build:dev

# Run development extension for Chrome
yarn start:chrome

# Run development extension for Firefox
yarn start:firefox

# Build Chrome extension (production version)
yarn build:chrome

# Build Firefox extension (production version)
yarn build:firefox
```

### Interface

Within `apps/namada-interface/`, we may issue the following commands:

```bash
# Make sure to build wasm dependencies before starting development server
yarn wasm:build

# Run development interface, hosted at http://localhost:3000
yarn dev:local

# Build production version
yarn build
```

There are also app-specific instructions in the [namada-interface README](apps/namada-interface/README.md) and the [extension README](apps/extension/README.md).

### Testing

#### Unit

At the root-level, we can issue commands for all packages in the monorepo. Following is an example:

```bash
# Execute all tests within monorepo
# Running this from the root project directory will run unit tests
# for all packages where a test script is defined
yarn test

# Lint all packages
yarn lint

# Fix linting on all packages
yarn lint:fix
```
