## Installation

Before using apps in this repo, we first need to install all dependencies.

### Ubuntu

_NOTE_ These instructions may work with other Ubuntu-based systems, but are only confirmed to work in Ubuntu.

```bash
# Install rustup
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Add WASM target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Install clang
sudo apt-get install -y clang

# Install pkg-config
sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config

# Install openssl development packages
sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev

# Install protoc
sudo apt-get install -y protobuf-compiler

# Install curl
sudo apt-get install -y curl

# Install npm
sudo apt-get install -y npm

# Install wasm-pack
curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh

# Install yarn and JS dependencies
npm install -g yarn

# within namada-interface/ base folder:
yarn

# Initialize Husky
yarn prepare
```

### macOS

```bash
# Install xcode
xcode-select --install

# Install rustup
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Add WASM target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Install clang
brew install clang

# Install pkg-config
brew install pkg-config

# Install openssl development packages
brew install libssl-dev

# Install protoc
brew install protobuf

# Install wasm-pack
curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh

# Install yarn and JS dependencies
npm install -g yarn

# within namada-interface/ base folder:
yarn

# Initialize Husky
yarn prepare
```

Finally, update your shell environment (e.g., in `~/.zshrc`) to set the following variables:

```
export CC=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang
AR=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-ar
```

#### Apple Silicon

On macOS, when using Apple Silicon architecture, in order to compile some packages for our wasm dependencies, you will need to install
the following:

```
# Mac M1/M2 only - install brew's version of llvm
brew install llvm
```

Then, in your shell profile (e.g., `~/.zshrc`), export the following environment variables:

```
# Mac M1/M2 only
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/include"
export CC=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang
export AR=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-ar
```

## Usage

### Local chain

Before you start the extension and interface, you will need at least a chain ID, an RPC URL, and an Indexer URL. This can either be a local chain or an
existing network. If you know the chain ID and URL, you can skip the following and simply enter these values on the app interface.

- To install and run Namada locally, refer to these [instructions](https://docs.namada.net/operators/networks/local-network).
- To run a local indexer, follow these [instructions](https://github.com/anoma/namada-indexer). Ensure that the `TENDERMINT_URL` in your `.env` file points to your local RPC (default is `http://localhost:27657`) or to a public RPC.

### Extension

Within `apps/extension/`, we may issue the following commands:

```bash
# Build wasm dependencies
yarn wasm:build

# Build wasm dependencies with debugging enabled
yarn wasm:build:dev

# Run development extension for Chrome
yarn start:chrome

# Run development extension for Firefox
yarn start:firefox

# Build Chrome extension (production version)
yarn build:chrome

# Build Firefox extension (production version)
yarn build:firefox
```

### Interface

Within `apps/namadillo/`, we may issue the following commands:

```bash
# Make sure to build wasm dependencies before starting development server
yarn wasm:build

# Run development interface, hosted at http://localhost:5173
yarn dev

# Build production version
yarn build
```

There are also app-specific instructions in the [namadillo README](apps/namadillo/README.md) and the [extension README](apps/extension/README.md).

### Testing

#### Unit

At the root-level, we can issue commands for all packages in the monorepo. Following is an example:

```bash
# Execute all tests within monorepo
# Running this from the root project directory will run unit tests
# for all packages where a test script is defined
yarn test

# Lint all packages
yarn lint

# Fix linting on all packages
yarn lint:fix
```

### Storybook

Storybook provides a documentation for UI components. Within `/storybook` folder, you can install and run it using the following commands:

```bash
# Install packages
yarn

# Run Storybook interface
yarn storybook
```

To generate a static build, you can run

```bash
yarn storybook-build
```

The generated output will be available at `/storybook/storybook-static` folder.
