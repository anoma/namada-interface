# Namada Browser Extension

This is the Namada Browser Extension project.

## Usage

```bash
# Install web-ext globally (this bundles Firefox extensions into a `.zip` file):
yarn global add web-ext

# Build wasm dependencies
yarn wasm:build # This needs to be run initially to ensure wasm dependencies are available

# Clean build files
yarn clean
yarn clean:chrome   # Clean only chrome build
yarn clean:firefox  # Clean only firefox build

# Build production web extension (chrome & Firefox)
yarn build         # Clean and build all extensions & wasm dependencies
yarn build:chrome  # Clean and build only for chrome (./build/chrome)
yarn build:firefox # Clean and build only firefox (./build/firefox)

# Run in development mode. This enables autoreloading when you install the extension at ./build/chrome
yarn start
yarn start:chrome  # Same as yarn start, which defaults to a Chrome target
yarn start:firefox # Run development extension in Firefox - use ./build/firefox

# If you are running `yarn dev:proxy` in the `namada-interface`, you can make use of that proxy by using:
yarn start:chrome:proxy
yarn start:firefox:proxy

# Run tests
yarn test
yarn test:watch

# Run eslint checks
yarn lint
yarn lint:fix
```

## Installation of extension

Once you have run `yarn build`, you can use the files in `./dist` to install the extension:

### Chrome

1. In Chrome, select `Manage Extensions`
2. Click the toggle to enable `Developer Mode`
3. Click `Load Unpacked` and point to the `dist` folder in this project

### Firefox

1. In Firefox, navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Select `Load Temporary Add-On...`
3. Navigate to either the `build/browser/manifest.json` or the `build/firefox/namada_extension-0.1.0.zip` file to install

The extension should be installed. Currently, this is enabled for `namada.me`, so navigating to that page will call the `content` scripts,
hopefully instantiating an instance of the `Namada()` class API for handling communication between client and key store.

## Notes

- Currently, Firefox does not support `manifest_version: 3`, and Chrome will be removing support for `V2` in 2023. As such, both manifest versions are supported.
- Manifest files can be found in `src/manifest/v2` (version 2, required for Firefox), and `src/manifest/v3` (others). There are independent files that
  extend a `_base.json` file for the target browser, which will be merged when building. Built extensions will be found under `build/chrome` and `build/firefox` (currently, these are the only two scripted build).
