# NOTICE FOR FIREFOX ADD-ON REVIEWERS

This is the monorepo which contains the source code for Namada Extension. Please follow the instructions
exactly as they are described below.

## Build instructions

**NOTE**: You _must_ use `yarn` to install dependencies! This is due to the fact that this is configured as a monorepo
using yarn workspaces. If you install via `npm install` or `npm i`, it will not resolve dependencies correctly.

If you don't already have Node v22 LTS and NPM v10, please follow these [instructions](#setting-up-node-and-npm)

These instructions should work for the default reviewer build environment.

```bash
sudo apt install protobuf-compiler build-essential curl pkg-config libssl-dev binaryen -y
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

# Proceed with standard installation when prompted

# Make sure to pull cargo into your current environment:
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"

# You must use yarn to install dependencies:
npm install -g yarn
export PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=true

# Run yarn to install dependencies
yarn

# Move into extension app directory
cd apps/extension

# Build wasm dependency:
yarn wasm:build
```

Then, issue the final build command for the Firefox add-on:

```bash
# Build the addon:
yarn build:firefox
```

The resulting extension is the ZIP file in `apps/extension/build/firefox`.
