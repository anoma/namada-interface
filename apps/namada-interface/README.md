### Configuration

Configuration is done by creating a `.env` file, based on [.env.sample](./.env.sample), and specifying the values you wish to override.

The following is an example of configuring the interface and extension to connect to testnets:

```bash
# NAMADA
REACT_APP_NAMADA_ALIAS=Namada Testnet
REACT_APP_NAMADA_CHAIN_ID=public-testnet-14.5d79b6958580
REACT_APP_NAMADA_URL=https://proxy.heliax.click/public-testnet-14.5d79b6958580/

# COSMOS
REACT_APP_COSMOS_ALIAS=Cosmos Testnet
REACT_APP_COSMOS_CHAIN_ID=theta-testnet-001
REACT_APP_COSMOS_URL=https://rpc.sentry-01.theta-testnet.polypore.xyz

# ETH
REACT_APP_ETH_ALIAS=Eth Testnet
REACT_APP_ETH_CHAIN_ID=0x7A69
REACT_APP_ETH_URL=https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_goerli
```

For more details on setting up your local environment for integration between the interface and the extension, see the [README.md](../../README.md) at the root of this repo.
