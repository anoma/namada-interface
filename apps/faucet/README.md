## Setup

To install dependencies, from the root `namada-interface` folder, run the following:

```bash
yarn
```

Then, look at the potential variables you may override in [.env.sample](./.env.sample) in `apps/faucet`. You can copy these variables into a `.env` file,
and they will be used when the application is built.

As an example, if all you want to override the the API url and faucet limit, you can override the following default values in a `.env`:

```bash
# Faucet API Endpoint override
NAMADA_INTERFACE_FAUCET_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000
NAMADA_INTERFACE_FAUCET_API_ENDPOINT=/api/v1/faucet

# Faucet limit, as defined in genesis toml
NAMADA_INTERFACE_FAUCET_LIMIT=1000
```

Each token address used in this form may be overridden via values specified in `.env` (see [.env.sample](./.env.sample)).

## Local Development

In `apps/faucet`, you can run the following scripts to test locally:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:8081`.

## Proxying Requests

If you are experiencing request failures due to CORS origin problems (e.g., if you are connecting to a remote server from a local dev instance),
you can launch the local CORS proxy via the following:

```bash
yarn dev:proxy
```

This will proxy the `NAMADA_INTERFACE_FAUCET_API_URL` (or default URL if this is unspecified) via a Node server, which should resolve the issue.

## Building the project

To build the final, static HTML version of this app, simply run the following:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will build the production version of the app, and the resulting bundle will be available in `apps/faucet/build`. This contents of this folder can be served on a web host
as a static HTML website.

## Notes

The logic for the API calls, as well as the mining logic can be found in [utils/index.ts](./src/utils/index.ts).

The form interface where these calls are invoked is located in [Faucet.tsx](./src/App/Faucet.tsx).

The default token address definitions can be found in [tokens.ts](./src/config/tokens.ts). Note that each of these token definitions has a corresponding [.env](./.env.sample) variable override
that can be used at build-time to modify the address.
